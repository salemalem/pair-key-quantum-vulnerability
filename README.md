# pair-key-quantum-vulnerability
Pair End to End encryption keys (Private and Public) are vulnerable once Qubits will be enough. More on RESEARCH.MD

# Tools used
Source code uses [mcdallas/cryptotools](https://github.com/mcdallas/cryptotools "CryptoTools Python") to generate vanity address and gain private key of it. Depending on the complexity of given regex inside vanity, more time will be consumed.
Current super computer might solve it even 1 million years, however, X quantum cubits are enough to solve in 10 minutes.
